"""The browser-native front-end: the game itself runs in the player's tab.

WebUserInterface puts the game on a server and the browser polls it, which means
one server-side game and one set of server-side save files shared by everyone
who opens the page. This front-end instead runs the whole Python game inside a
Web Worker under Pyodide, so every tab has its own game and its own saves - the
latter kept in the browser's IndexedDB (see tak.saves.browser and
web/assets/game-worker.js).

Only the transport differs from WebUserInterface, which this class subclasses:
every screen the player sees is still built by WebUserInterface's primitives, so
a new screen type is written once and appears in both. Here a screen is posted
to the main thread as a JSON string, and the player's response is read from the
SharedArrayBuffer ring buffer that boot.js writes into.

Why a ring buffer rather than Worker messages: the game loop is synchronous, so
it blocks the Worker while waiting for input, and a blocked Worker can never run
an onmessage handler. Shared memory is readable without the event loop, so the
main thread can hand input to a blocked game.
