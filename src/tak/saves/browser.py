"""Flush a game's save files to browser storage when running under Pyodide.

The Pyodide front-end runs the whole game inside a Web Worker, so its save
slots live in the Worker's in-memory Emscripten filesystem - memory that is
discarded the moment the tab closes. game-worker.js exposes a ``syncSaves()``
JavaScript global that walks the save directory and hands the files to the
main thread, which writes them to IndexedDB (see that file for why the write
cannot happen in the Worker itself).

Every code path that writes or deletes a save must call ``syncBrowserSaves()``
afterwards, or the change lives only until the tab is closed. SaveFileManager
does so for the deletions it performs; a game does so after its own writes.

Outside Pyodide (console and the HTTP web front-end) the ``js`` module does
not exist, so this is a no-op and the on-disk files are the real saves.

    only lands there once something imports it. So this has to actually
    attempt the import: looking in sys.modules alone reports "not a browser"
    while running in one, which silently turned saving into a no-op and made
    the Pyodide front-end refuse to start.

    sys.modules is still consulted first, and `import` would consult it anyway,
    so a test can inject a stand-in under that name.
